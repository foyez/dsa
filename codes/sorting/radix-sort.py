# O(n * k) time complexity where k is the number of bits (i.e. logâ‚‚(max_value))
# Best for integers, not for negative numbers unless adjusted.

# How it works:
# Radix sort processes the bits of the number from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB).
# For each bit position, it partitions the array into two groups:
# Numbers with that bit = 0
# Numbers with that bit = 1
# This is done using bitwise AND: (num >> bit) & 1
